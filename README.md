This model simulates a free-market in which dynamics, such as changes in price, result from agent-level interactions. The model considers three types of agent: value investors, artificially intelligent trend investors and market-makers. Interractions between the agents are constrained to occur on a predefined network, such that trades can only occur between agents linked with a network edge. This contribution extends the range of possible investigations to consider the effect of various market structures on price movements. 

This model exhibits a number of similarities to the real world: a characteristic fat-tailed distribution of price changes whose ranks follow a power law; a skew negatively correlated to market-maker positioning; the emergence of characteristic price patterns (or ”technicals”) and more.
